Project Overview

This project was created for the Kaggle Competitions Equitable Competition. This competition is part of the Break Through Tech AI Program as the Spring Semester Project. Our goal is to build an inclusive machine learning model for dermatology and use the datasets provided to train a model that can classify 16 different skin conditions across diverse skin tones. This impacts society by raising awareness on how AI systems can perpetuate racism, sexism, ableism, and other harmful forms of discrimination and we need to build better and more accurate systems that can work with all forms of skin types.
